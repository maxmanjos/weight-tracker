# weight-tracker

One major goal I have been chasing recently is to put on weight and transform my body. The idea of putting
on weight as I was lifting was simple to me, but what was hard was keeping track of my progress. I was not
able to stay consistent when writing down my progress with a pen and paper. So i decided to write a program
to do it for me.

Weight tracker is a simple program that allows users to input their weights on certain days and presents
a chart representation of their progress. This app is designed to help users hold themselves accountable on
their weight gain or loss journey.

uses localStorage to store users data and pulls from that dataset to update the chart.
implements a chart using chartJS.
